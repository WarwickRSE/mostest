Pre-requisites:

Python (probably since about 3.10)
PyTest (simple Pip install)

Git is not necessary, except for optional hooks/actions
    If doing the Github Actions parts, check current state of Actions credits
    for free accounts


Maths to roughly A-level
    The examples freely assume some basic properties of numbers, basic properties
    of integers, familiarity with
    polynomials, root-finding, random numbers etc. None of this needs to be written
    by attendees, but its assumed that properties of these, and thus how to approach
    testing their function, is known.

Schedule:

About 15 minutes to talk through the Introduction
About 1 hour for Part 1, going through Guided examples
About 1 hour for Part 2, going through PyTest
    A big chunk of this is section 4, writing tests for real code. The MontyHall problem is used as its familiar and illustrates some real problems
About 15 mins for a basic Demo of Part 3, hooks or actions
