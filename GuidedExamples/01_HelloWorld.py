def HelloWorld(name):
    """This is a docstring - a special line interpreted as a description of the function.
    It also counts as the body of the function. This means this code will successfully do nothing
    even before you fill in your part"""
    #YOUR CODE HERE
    #Write the statement to say "Hello name!"

#ENTRY POINT
if __name__ == "__main__":
    """Another Function, another Docstring"""

    #Go fill in the body of the HelloWorld function above, and then come back

    #YOUR CODE HERE
    #Call the HelloWorld function. Pass it your name

    #Now, run this script. Make sure you understand what line 10 is doing.
    #Instead of _running_ the script, start python/a notebook and import it. Now, run just the HelloWorld function

    #Once you've got that working in your chosen runtime, you're good to move on
