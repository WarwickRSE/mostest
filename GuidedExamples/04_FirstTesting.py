#ENTRY POINT
if __name__ == "__main__":
    #In this exercise we're going to test a function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers
    # Ignore the fact that there is a built-in function to do this, and that the code I have
    # written is not very good. We're testing it, not critiquing!

    #Write your tests below for the 'sumItems' function

    #Recall what we dicussed in the introduction - what sorts of test inputs can you give?
