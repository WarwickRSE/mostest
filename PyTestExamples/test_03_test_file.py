#ENTRY POINT

#Like we said in the previous exercise, we should really be separating our tests from our code. 
# This means we will want to 'import' our code functions into our test file. 

#We've created a file called 'code_example.py' where we have put the code to test
# Write the command to import everything from it
#IMPORT COMMAND HERE

#Now take your tests from before and organise them into a 'suite'

#This means: 
# creating at least a separate test function for each 'real' function
# probably creating a separate test function for each 'testing angle'
# Think about it like this: if a test fails, you want this to help you
#    figure out what is wrong. So giving a test a useful name, organising
#    similar tests together will help. We don't need to have one test per
#    assertion though!

#For an example of how we would suggest organising tests for the function in code_example
# see Answers/PyTest03_test_suite
