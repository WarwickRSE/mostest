#ENTRY POINT
#Now you've seen a simple test suite, it's time to start looking at "real" code
# If you have a suitable piece of code (a hundred to a few hundred lines), 
# divided into functions, feel free to use this. 

#If not, we've provided a couple of TestableCode files you can use. 
# Pick one, have a read, run the code, and then start writing a test suite. 

#We don't have model solutions for this section - we have some hints, and we
# can give you feedback - just ask!
