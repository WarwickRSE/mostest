#ENTRY POINT
#Now you've seen a simple test suite, it's time to start looking at "real" code
# If you have a suitable piece of code (a hundred to a few hundred lines), 
# divided into functions, feel free to use this. 

#Otherwise we have provided a testable piece of code to investigate the following:

# My Great Uncle Rupert once lost his prized flat-cap in a Poker game against
# a game-show host, a professor of mathematics and an insurance adjuster, and
# lost his trust for all three.
# Ever since, he has insisted that he has a strategy for the Monty-Hall game
# which wins >50 % of the time _without_ listening to that darn host!
# The file TestableCode_MontyHall simulates the game, with a contestant who
# picks randomly, and one using Rupert's special strategy. Your challenge
# is to write sufficient tests to prove that the code matches the known
# answer for the random contestant, and, one test to, hopefully, prove to Rupert that
# his strategy does no better than that. 


#IMPORTANT: it's OK, in fact it's great!, if your tests reveal potential 'oversights' in
# the code, such as assuming things which are not verified. As we've said, it's not _always_
# the case that we should add every check we might think of. See DefensiveCoding for some
# notes on why not. 

#We don't have model solutions for this section - we have some hints, and we
# can give you feedback - just ask!
